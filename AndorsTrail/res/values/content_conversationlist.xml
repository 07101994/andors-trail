{vacor_13|The bandits took my notes for the spell and took off before I could call the guards.||{{N|vacor_14|||||}}|};
{vacor_14|After years of work,  I can\'t seem to remember the last parts of the spell.||{{N|vacor_15|||||}}|};

{vacor_17|I knew I couldn\'t trust... Wait, what? You actually said yes? Hah, well then.||{{N|vacor_18|||||}}|};
{vacor_18|Ok, find the four pieces of my rift spell that the bandits took, and bring the pieces to me.|{{0|vacor|20|}}|{{N|vacor_19|||||}}|};
{vacor_19|There were four bandits, and they all headed south of Fallhaven after I was attacked.||{{N|vacor_20|||||}}|};
{vacor_20|You should search the southern parts of Fallhaven for the four bandits.||{{N|vacor_21|||||}}|};
{vacor_21|Please hurry! I am so eager to open up the rift.. Erm, I mean finish the spell. Nothing odd with that right?|||};
{vacor_return1|Hello again. How is the search for my missing pieces of the rift spell going?||{{I have found all pieces.|vacor_40||vacor_spell|4|0|}{What was I supposed to do again?|vacor_18|||||}{Could you tell me the whole story again?|vacor_4|||||}}|};

{vacor_42|Now I should be able to finish the rift spell and open up the Shadow rift .. erm I mean open up new possibilities. Yes, that\'s what I meant.||{{N|vacor_43|||||}}|};
{vacor_43|The only obstacle between me and continuing my rift spell research is that stupid Unzel fellow.||{{N|vacor_44|||||}}|};
{vacor_44|Unzel was my apprentice a while ago. But he started to annoy me with his questions and talk about morality.||{{N|vacor_45|||||}}|};
{vacor_45|He said that my spell making was disrupting the will of the Shadow.||{{N|vacor_46|||||}}|};
{vacor_46|Bah, The Shadow. What has it ever done for ME?!||{{N|vacor_47|||||}}|};
{vacor_47|I shall one day cast my rift spell and we will be rid of the Shadow.||{{N|vacor_48|||||}}|};
{vacor_48|Anyway. I have a feeling that Unzel sent those bandits after me, and if I don\'t stop him he will probably send more.||{{N|vacor_49|||||}}|};

{unzel_10|Vacor and I used to travel together. But he started to get obsessed with his spell making.||{{N|unzel_11|||||}}|};
{unzel_11|He even started to question the Shadow. I knew I had to do something to stop him!||{{N|unzel_12|||||}}|};
{unzel_12|I started questioning him about what he was up to, but he just wanted to keep on going.||{{N|unzel_13|||||}}|};

{farrik_2|I\'m Farrik, Umar\'s brother.||{{What do you do around here?|farrik_3|||||}{What can you tell me about the thieves guild?|farrik_4|||||}}|};
{farrik_3|I mostly manage our trading with other guilds and keep an eye on what the thieves need to be as effective as they can be.||{{What can you tell me about the thieves guild?|farrik_4|||||}}|};
{farrik_4|We try to keep to ourselves as much as possible, and help our fellow thieves as much as possible.||{{Any recent events happening?|farrik_5|||||}}|};
{farrik_5|Well, there was one thing a few weeks ago. One of our guild members got arrested for trespassing.||{{N|farrik_6|||||}}|};
{farrik_6|The Fallhaven guard has really started to get annoyed at us lately. Probably because we have been very successful in our recent missions.||{{N|farrik_7|||||}}|};
{farrik_7|The guards have increased their security lately, leading to them arresting one of our members.||{{N|farrik_8|||||}}|};
{farrik_8|He is currently held in the jail here in Fallhaven, pending transfer to Feygard.||{{What did he do?|farrik_9|||||}}|};
{farrik_9|Oh, nothing serious. He was trying to get into the catacombs of Fallhaven church.||{{N|farrik_10|||||}}|};
{farrik_10|But now that you have helped us with that mission, I guess we don\'t need to go there anymore.||{{N|farrik_11|||||}}|};
{farrik_11|I guess I can trust you with this secret. We are planning a mission tonight to help him out of the prison.|{{0|farrik|10|}}|{{Those guards really seem annoying.|farrik_13|||||}{After all, if he wasn\'t allowed down there, then the guards are right to arrest him.|farrik_12|||||}}|};
{farrik_12|Yeah, I guess so. But for the guild\'s sake, we would rather have our friend freed than imprisoned.||{{Maybe I should tell the guards that you are planning to get him out?|farrik_15|||||}{Don\'t worry, your secret plan to free him is safe with me.|farrik_14|||||}{[Lie] Don\'t worry, your secret plan to free him is safe with me.|farrik_14|||||}}|};
{farrik_13|Oh yes, they are. The people also dislike them in general, it\'s not just us in the thieves guild.||{{Is there anything I can do to help you with those annoying guards?|farrik_16|||||}}|};
{farrik_14|Thank you. Now please leave me.|||};
{farrik_15|Whatever, they wouldn\'t believe you anyway.|{{0|farrik|30|}}||};
{farrik_16|Are you sure you want to annoy the guards? If they catch word of you being involved, you could get into a lot of trouble.||{{No problem, I can handle myself!|farrik_18|||||}{There might be a reward for this later on. I\'m in.|farrik_18|||||}{On second thought, maybe I should keep out of this.|farrik_17|||||}}|};
{farrik_17|Sure, it\'s up to you.||{{Good luck on your mission.|farrik_14|||||}{Maybe I should tell the guards that you are planning to get him out?|farrik_15|||||}}|};
{farrik_18|Good.||{{N|farrik_19|||||}}|};
{farrik_19|Ok, here is the plan. The guard captain has a bit of a drinking problem.||{{N|farrik_20|||||}}|};
{farrik_20|If we were to supply him with some mead that we have prepared, we might just be able to sneak our friend out during the night, when the captain is sleeping off the drunkenness.||{{N|farrik_20a|||||}}|};
{farrik_20a|Our cook can prepare a special brew of mead for you that will knock him out.||{{N|farrik_21|||||}}|};
{farrik_21|He would probably need to be persuaded to drink on duty too. If that should fail, he could probably be bribed instead.||{{N|farrik_22|||||}}|};
{farrik_22|How does that sound to you? Do you think you are up to it?||{{Sure, sounds easy!|farrik_23|||||}{Sounds a bit dangerous, but I guess I\'ll try.|farrik_23|||||}{No, this is really starting to sound like a bad idea.|farrik_17|||||}}|};
{farrik_23|Good. Report back to me when you have gotten the guard captain to drink that special mead.|{{0|farrik|20|}}|{{Will do|farrik_14|||||}}|};
{farrik_return_1|Hello again my friend. How goes your mission to get the guard captain drunk?||{{I am not done yet, but I am working on it.|farrik_23|||||}{[Lie] It is done. He should be no problem during the night.|farrik_26|farrik:50||||}{It is done. He should be no problem during the night.|farrik_24|farrik:60||||}}|};

{umar_return_2|Anything else I can help you with?||{{Can you repeat what you said about Andor?|umar_5|||||}{Nice to meet you. Goodbye.|X|||||}}|};
{umar_novisit_1|Hello. How did your search go?||{{What search?|umar_2|||||}}|};
{umar_2|Last time we talked, you asked for the way to Lodar\'s Hideaway. Did you find it?||{{We have never met.|umar_3|||||}{You must have me confused with my brother Andor. We look very much alike.|umar_4|||||}}|};
{umar_3|Oh. I must have you mixed up with someone else.||{{My brother Andor and I look very much alike.|umar_4|||||}}|};
{umar_4|Really? Never mind I said anything then.|{{0|andor|51|}}|{{I guess that means that Andor was here. What was he doing?|umar_5|||||}}|};
{umar_5|He came here a while ago, asking a lot of questions about what relation the Thieves Guild has to the Shadow and to the royal guard in Feygard.||{{N|umar_6|||||}}|};
{umar_6|We in the Thieves Guild really don\'t care much for the Shadow. Nor do we care for the royal guard.||{{N|umar_7|||||}}|};
{umar_7|We try to be above their bickering and differences. They may fight as much as they want, but the Thieves Guild will outlive them all.||{{What conflict?|umar_conflict_1|||||}{Tell me more about what Andor asked for|umar_andor_1|||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_1|Where have you been the last couple of years? Don\'t you know of the brewing conflict?||{{N|umar_conflict_2|||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_2|The royal guard, led by Lord Geomyr in Feygard, are trying to ward off the recent increase in illegal activities, and are therefore imposing more restrictions on what is allowed and not.||{{N|umar_conflict_3|||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_3|The priests of the Shadow, mostly seated in Nor City, are opponents to the new restrictions, saying that they limit the ways that they can please the Shadow.||{{N|umar_conflict_4|||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_4|In turn, the rumor is that the priests of the Shadow are planning to overthrow Lord Geomyr and his forces.||{{N|umar_conflict_5|||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_5|Also, the rumor is that the priests of the Shadow are still doing their rituals, despite of them being banned.||{{N|umar_conflict_6|||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_6|Lord Geomyr and his royal guard on the other hand, are still trying their best to rule in a way that they feel is fair.||{{N|umar_conflict_7|||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_7|We in the Thieves Guild try not to get involved in the conflict. Our business is so far unaffected by all this.||{{Thank you for telling me.|umar_return_2|||||}{Whatever, that doesn\'t concern me.|umar_return_2|||||}}|};
{umar_andor_1|He asked me for my support, and asked of how to find Lodar.||{{Who is Lodar?|umar_andor_2|||||}}|};
{umar_andor_2|Lodar? He is one of our famous potion makers in the Thieves Guild. He can make all sorts of strong sleeping potions, healing potions and cures.||{{N|umar_andor_3|||||}}|};
{umar_andor_3|But his specialty is, of course, his poisons. His poison can harm even the largest of monsters.||{{What would Andor want with him?|umar_andor_4|||||}}|};
{umar_andor_4|I don\'t know. Maybe he was looking for a potion.|{{0|andor|55|}}|{{So, where can I find this Lodar?|umar_lodar_1|||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_1|I really shouldn\'t tell you. How to get to him is one of our closely guarded secrets in the guild. His hideaway is only reachable by our members.||{{N|umar_lodar_2|||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_2|However, I heard that you helped us find the key of Luthor. This is something we have been trying to get to for a long time.||{{N|umar_lodar_3|||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_3|Ok, I\'ll tell you how to get to Lodar\'s Hideaway. But you have to promise to keep it a secret. Do not tell anyone. Not even those that appear to be members of the Thieves Guild.||{{Ok, I\'ll promise to keep it a secret.|umar_lodar_4|||||}{I can\'t give any guarantees, but I will try.|umar_lodar_4|||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_4|Good. The thing is, you not only need to find the place itself, but you also need to utter the correct words to be allowed entry by the guardian.||{{N|umar_lodar_5|||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_5|The only one that understands the language of the guardian is the old man Ogam in Vilegard.|{{0|lodar|10|}}|{{N|umar_lodar_6|||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_6|You should travel to the town of Vilegard and find Ogam. He can help you get the right words to enter Lodar\'s Hideaway.|{{0|lodar|15|}}|{{How do I get to Vilegard?|umar_vilegard_1|||||}{Thank you. There was something else I wanted to talk about.|umar_return_2|||||}{Thank you, goodbye.|X|||||}}|};
{umar_vilegard_1|You travel southeast from Fallhaven. When you reach the main road and the Foaming Flask tavern, head south. It\'s not very far to the southeast from here.||{{N|umar_return_2|||||}}|};

{jolnor_gaintrust_6|North of Vilegard is a tavern called the Foaming Flask. In my opinion, this tavern is a guard station in guise for Feygard.||{{N|jolnor_gaintrust_7|||||}}|};
{jolnor_gaintrust_7|The tavern is almost always visited by the Feygard royal guard of Lord Geomyr.||{{N|jolnor_gaintrust_8|||||}}|};

{jolnor_gaintrust_10|Yes, their reason is to make life miserable for us, I am sure.||{{What do you want me to do?|jolnor_gaintrust_11|||||}}|};
{jolnor_gaintrust_11|My reports say that there is a guard stationed outside the tavern, to keep an eye on potential dangers.||{{N|jolnor_gaintrust_12|||||}}|};
{jolnor_gaintrust_12|I want you to make sure the guard disappears somehow. How you do that is purely up to you.|{{0|jolnor|10|}}|{{I am not sure I should upset the Feygard patrol guards.

{throdna_6|This is the mages\' chamber in Blackwater Mountain. We devote our time to the studies of the Shadow and its descendants.||{
	{Descendants?|throdna_8|||||}
	{Let\'s go back to my other questions.|throdna_loop_1|||||}
	}|};
{throdna_7|I am Throdna. One of the most learned persons around, if you ask me.||{{N|throdna_loop_1|||||}}|};
{throdna_8|Kazaul, the Shadow spawn of red marrow.|{{0|kazaul|8|}}|{{N|throdna_9|||||}}|};
{throdna_9|We have been trying to read all we can on Kazaul, and the ritual. It seems we might be too late.||{{What do you mean?|throdna_10|||||}}|};
{throdna_10|The ritual. We believe that Kazaul will manifest in our presence soon.||{{N|throdna_11|||||}}|};
{throdna_11|We must learn more about the Kazaul ritual, to gain its power and learn to use it for our purposes.||{

{throdna_12|As I said, we want to learn more about the ritual itself.|{{0|kazaul|9|}}|{{N|throdna_13|||||}}|};
{throdna_13|A while ago, we were on the verge of getting our hands on the whole ritual itself, but the messenger was killed under most interesting circumstances while traveling up here.||{{N|throdna_14|||||}}|};
{throdna_14|We knew he had the parts of the complete ritual on him, but since he was killed and we could not get to him because of the monsters - his notes were lost to us.||{{N|throdna_15|||||}}|};
{throdna_15|According to our sources, there should be five parts of the ritual scattered across the mountain. Three of them describing the ritual itself, and two describing the Kazaul chant used to summon the guardian.||{{N|throdna_15_1|||||}}|};
{throdna_16|Hm, maybe you could be of use here..||{
	{I would be glad to help.|throdna_18|||||}

{throdna_return_5|If that were to happen, we could not complete our research about the ritual or Kazaul itself, all our efforts would be lost.||{{N|throdna_return_6|||||}}|};

{rogorn_story_9|You have got that right. They are always trying to make life hard for us little people. Let me tell you my side of the story.||{{N|rogorn_story_r_1|||||}}|};
{rogorn_story_10|Law and order? What use do we have of that if we are always persecuted by them and do not even have the freedom to live our lives the way we want?||{{N|rogorn_story_11|||||}}|};

{rogorn_story_12|Good to hear that there still are some people willing to make a stand against Feygard. Let me tell you my side of the story.||{{N|rogorn_story_r_1|||||}}|};
{rogorn_story_r_1|Me and my boys here travelled from our home in Nor City to these northern lands a few days ago.||{{N|rogorn_story_r_2|||||}}|};
{rogorn_story_r_2|We had never been here ourselves. We had only heard stories about how tough the guards from Feygard were, and how they held their precious law above all.||{{N|rogorn_story_r_3|||||}}|};
{rogorn_story_r_3|Anyway, we got wind of a certain business opportunity here up north. One where we would be on the receiving end of a very profitable deal.||{{N|rogorn_story_r_4|||||}}|};
{rogorn_story_r_4|So we went here to conduct our business. But I guess the guards from Feygard must have been tipped off about us, since we noticed that we were being followed by the guards after a while.||{{N|rogorn_story_r_5|||||}}|};
{rogorn_story_r_5|Not willing to risk anything, considering the rumors we had heard about the guards from there, we did the only reasonable thing we could do - we abandoned the plan right away and left, before we could conduct the business we had planned.||{{N|rogorn_story_r_6|||||}}|};
{rogorn_story_r_6|But something must have upset the guards there anyway. Now we hear that we are accused of murder and theft in Feygard, without even being there ourselves.|{{0|rogorn|35|}}|{

	{I believe your story. How can I help you?|rogorn_story_r_9|||||}

{gandoren_tr_1|I\'m sorry, we only trade with allies of Feygard.|||};
{gandoren_2|This guardhouse is a safe haven for merchants travelling the Duleian road. We keep law and order around here, for Feygard.||{

	{The Duleian road?|gandoren_dr_1|||||}

{gandoren_dr_1|Noticed the large road outside? That\'s the Duleian road. It goes all the way from the glorious city of Feygard up in the northwest down to the wretched Nor City in the southeast.||{{Any recent events happening?|gandoren_3|||||}}|};
{gandoren_3|Oh sure. Recently, we have had to focus our attention to the troubles up in Loneford.||{{N|gandoren_4|||||}}|};
{gandoren_4|That situation has forced us to be more alert than usual, and we have had to send some guards up there to help them.||{{N|gandoren_5|||||}}|};
{gandoren_5|This also means that we cannot focus as much on our usual tasks as we normally do, but instead need help with doing basic tasks just to hold our grounds.|{{0|feygard_shipment|10|}}|{

{gandoren_6|Well, we usually do not employ just any civilian. Our tasks are important for Feygard - and by extension, important for the people. Our tasks are usually not suited for commoners like you.||{{N|gandoren_7|||||}}|};
{gandoren_7|But I guess the recent situation really leaves us no choice. We need to keep the guards in Loneford, and we also need to deliver this shipment. At the moment, we cannot do both.||{{N|gandoren_8|||||}}|};

{algangror_story|Let me tell you my story.||{
	{Please do.|algangror_story1|||||}
	{Can we just skip to the end?|algangror_cmp1|||||}
	}|};
{algangror_story1|You see, I used to live in the city of Remgard. The times were good, and the city prospered.||{{N|algangror_story2|||||}}|};
{algangror_story2|Our crops grew well, and some people had very fortunate trading agreements with other cities, making the life for most of us living in Remgard very easy.||{{N|algangror_story3|||||}}|};
{algangror_story3|I even sold some of the baskets that I used to make to a wealthy merchant that visited us from Nor City.||{{N|algangror_story4|||||}}|};
{algangror_story4|However, even the easy life gets boring after a while. I believe it is in our nature to strive for new and better things, to free us from the boredom of day-to-day life.||{{N|algangror_story5|||||}}|};
{algangror_story5|I wanted to learn more of things that I knew nothing about, and wanted to explore things I had only read of in books before.||{{N|algangror_story6|||||}}|};
{algangror_story6|So I went to Nor City myself, and visited many .. interesting people and .. dark corners.||{{N|algangror_story7|||||}}|};
{algangror_story7|Naturally, I was thrilled of the knowledge I gained from the experience, and from what I learned while there.||{{What then?|algangror_story8|||||}}|};
{algangror_story8|As I got back home, I wanted to continue practicing what I had observed and learned while in Nor City.||{{N|algangror_story9|||||}}|};
{algangror_story9|You could say I got obsessed with learning more. I guess the others living in Remgard did not .. share my enthusiasm. Some of them even questioned the fact that I wanted to learn more.||{{N|algangror_story10|||||}}|};
{algangror_story10|So I told myself that others would not hinder me in my curiosity to better myself.||{{N|algangror_story11|||||}}|};
{algangror_story11|Those books that I bought from the Blackmarrow residence in Nor City - I must have read them all perhaps five times over. This was something completely new to me, and at the same time very exciting.||{{What then?|algangror_story12|||||}}|};
{algangror_story12|For some reason, the others in Remgard started giving me strange looks, and I could hear the whispers behind my back.||{{N|algangror_story13|||||}}|};
{algangror_story13|I was even barred from the tavern. \'People come here for a good time, and we don\'t want people like you here ruining that\' they said. What fools they are.||{{N|algangror_story14|||||}}|};
{algangror_story14|I heard one woman whispering to her boy, \'Don\'t look at her, she\'ll turn you to stone!\'. Others just turned the other way when they met me.||{{N|algangror_story15|||||}}|};
{algangror_story15|What fools they are.||{{So what happened?|algangror_story16|||||}}|};
{algangror_story16|One day, Jhaeld showed up at my doorstep with a group of guards.||{{N|algangror_story17|||||}}|};
{algangror_story17|The people of Remgard had decided that I could not stay there anymore, he said. The things I did were causing other people harm, he said.||{{N|algangror_story18|||||}}|};
{algangror_story18|What had I done, I asked myself? I had never hurt anyone, much less affected anyone with my .. experiments. Am I not allowed to do what I wish?||{{N|algangror_story19|||||}}|};
{algangror_story19|I had little chance to argue, however. The guards led me out of the city. They did not even let me gather my things. All my books, all my notes and all my findings - gone. I lost everything.|{{0|fiveidols|60|}}|{{What now?|algangror_story20|||||}}|};
{algangror_story20|All this happened several seasons ago. I knew I had to get revenge for what they did to me.||{{N|algangror_story21|||||}}|};
{algangror_story21|Oh, how I despise them all. The people that gave me those looks, the people that whispered behind my back, and most of all that fool Jhaeld.||{{N|algangror_story22|||||}}|};
{algangror_story22|So, I decided to extend my .. experiments .. to larger things. To people, to living things. This is the perfect opportunity to learn even more than what is in the books.||{{N|algangror_story23|||||}}|};
{algangror_story23|To think that I could do it while at the same time get revenge on those despicable people - it\'s an excellent plan, if I may say so myself. He he.||{{So, what happened to all those people that have gone missing?|algangror_story24|||||}}|};
{algangror_story24|I lured them here. Once I managed to trap them, I placed a curse on them that, in theory, should have only made them unable to speak.||{{N|algangror_story25|||||}}|};
{algangror_story25|Maybe I haven\'t understood everything correctly from the books that I have read, since instead of making them unable to speak, they were all turned into rats instead.||{{N|algangror_story26|||||}}|};
{algangror_story26|Practice makes perfect, I suppose. Ha ha.||{{Wait, does this mean that those rats I killed for you were..|algangror_story27|||||}}|};
{algangror_story27|Oh yes. With your help, they are now one less problem to deal with, so to speak. He he.||{{N|algangror_story28|||||}}|};
{algangror_story28|So, that\'s my story. Thank you for listening to it.|{{0|fiveidols|61|}}|{
	{I understand, and I agree with your actions.|algangror_story29a|||||}

{ulirfendor_5_1|If my understanding is correct, this shrine is a remnant of Kazaul.||{{N|ulirfendor_6|||||}}|};
{ulirfendor_6|The writings on it have almost vanished, but I have managed to read parts of it. It speaks in an ancient Kazaul tongue, so all parts are not clear to me.||{{N|ulirfendor_7|||||}}|};

{ulirfendor_13|Something about \'re-birth from within the followers\'. Not sure I have translated that part correctly, but I think that is what it says. Definitely something about re-birth or birth.||{{N|ulirfendor_14|||||}}|};

{ulirfendor_infected_13|The Kazaul rotworms need a living being to feed upon, before their eggs can hatch. Their eggs can slowly kill a person from the inside, and the worms themselves cause the carrier to become weak during the whole process.||{{N|ulirfendor_infected_14|||||}}|};

{ulirfendor_helmet_1|Could it be? Hmm. Let me look at that thing.||{{N|ulirfendor_helmet_2|||||}}|};

{ulirfendor_helmet_5|It could either be the helmet itself, or that the helmet has some effect on whoever wears it, meaning that the wearer will become the Dark Protector.||{{N|ulirfendor_helmet_6|||||}}|};

{talion_infect_3|Nasty things, they are. I have seen people going mad from the stomach pains, and I have seen people being eaten alive from the inside.||{

{talion_infect_5|A lich of Kazaul eh? Then I am sure that whatever ails you are those cursed rotworms.||{{N|talion_infect_3|||||}}|};
{talion_demon_1|Just to be sure, you did kill whatever creature that infected you with this, right?||{

{talion_infect_14|Secondly, I will need some animal fur to go with that. Two pieces of animal hair will surely do. I\'m sure any old animal fur from the wilderness outside town will do.||{{N|talion_infect_15|||||}}|};
{talion_infect_15|Third, I will need a gland of poison from a creature called the Irdegh.||{{N|talion_infect_16|||||}}|};

{jhaeld_alg_5|She used to live here in Remgard, during the days of prosperity. She even helped with the crops on some days.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_6|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_6|Then something happened. She started getting ideas, and occasionally locked herself in her house for several days. No one really knew what she was doing in there, but we all knew that she was up to no good.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_7|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_7|I can still recall the stench that came from her house. Ugh. What could possibly smell that bad?||{{N|jhaeld_alg_8|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_8|Anyway, we started questioning her, and tried to persuade her to tell what she was up to. Stubborn and crazy as she is, she refused of course.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_9|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_9|Things started getting worse, and the stench spread like a deep fog over the whole town. All of us living here in Remgard knew we had to act before she did something that could hurt us all.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_10|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_10|So we forced her to explain herself.||{{Did she tell?|jhaeld_alg_11|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_11|Would you believe it, she told us that what she believed in, and what she was doing was no concern of ours. She even had the stomach to tell us that she wanted to be left alone.||{{What did you do?|jhaeld_alg_12|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_12|Of course, we did what any sane man would do. We forced her to abandon her house and find somewhere else to live. Somewhere other than Remgard.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_13|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_13|You should have seen her. Nails long as your finger, and her face full of unwashed hair. Clearly, she was crazy and could not be reasoned with.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_14|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_14|When we marched her out of town, the children started crying out of fear for her.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_15|||||}}|};
{jhaeld_alg_15|The worst thing though, is that she said she would put a curse on all of us.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_16|||||}}|};

{jhaeld_alg_17|Yes. Her being back would explain the missing people. She must have done something to them. I fear for the worst.||{{N|jhaeld_alg_18|||||}}|};
